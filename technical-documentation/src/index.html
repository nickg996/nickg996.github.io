          <li>Web standards and best practices (such as accessibility and cross-browser compatibility</li>
          <li>HTML, the language that gives web content structure and meaning</li>
          <li>CSS, the language used to style web pages</li>
          <li>JavaScript, the scripting language used to create dynamic functionality on the web</li>
